# Cybersecurity-Dashboar
1. Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Dashboard  
• An interactive cybersecurity analytics dashboard built to monitor, analyze, and visualize cyber threat patterns. The project helps identify attack trends, vulnerable systems, and security risks to support data-driven decision-making.


2.Short Description / Purpose : 
• An interactive cybersecurity analytics dashboard built to monitor, analyze, and visualize cyber threat patterns. The project helps identify attack trends, vulnerable systems, and security risks to support data-driven decision-making.


3.Tech Stack :
• Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboard Development)
• Python (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Pandas, NumPy)
• Excel / CSV (Data Handling)
• DAX (Calculated Measures & KPIs)


4.Data Source :
• The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing cybersecurity incident data such as attack types, severity levels, affected systems, and timestamps.


5.Features / Highlights :
> Business Problem :
• Organizations face increasing cybersecurity threats but lack centralized visibility into attack patterns, severity distribution, and system vulnerabilities. Without structured analytics, security teams struggle to prioritize risks effectively.

> Goal of the Project :
• To create an interactive dashboard that tracks cyber incidents.
• To analyze attack frequency, type distribution, and severity trends.
• To provide actionable insights for improving threat response strategies.

> Walkthrough of Key Visuals :
• KPI Cards – Total Incidents, High-Risk Threats, Average Severity Score
• Bar Chart – Distribution of attack types (Phishing, Malware, DDoS, etc.)
• Line Chart – Incident trends over time
• Pie/Donut Chart – Severity level breakdown
• Geographical Map – Region-wise attack distribution
• Filter Panel – Dynamic filtering by attack type, severity, and time period
